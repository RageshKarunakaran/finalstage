<p>In today’s unique, post-Covid job market, finding a full-time role after graduation can seem a daunting task. Now, more than ever, internships for college students are essential elements of career preparation. Hands-on experience is just as important as coursework for those looking to make a smooth transition into the global workforce.
An internship is the perfect opportunity to explore future career options, and to begin to build both a portfolio and a professional network.</p>
<p><strong>Entering a unique job market</strong></p>
 
<p>For many university graduates, it can take several years to build up a strong CV or resume. Of course, the more professional experience you have to complement your degree, the more valuable you are to potential employers. Those who complete internships, are a step ahead of the competition, and have CVs that boast the professional experience so many recent graduates lack.</p>
<p>These placements show hiring managers that you are both motivated and organized, and can thrive in a professional setting. If you’ve ever dreamed of working remotely or working abroad, it’s never too early to start down that path!</p>

<p><strong>Career readiness</strong></p>
<p>Career readiness in today’s economic climate may look different than it has in previous years. College internships provide several foundational skills required for a successful career in any field, no matter the job market. Regardless of your area of study or the industry you hope to enter, potential employers look for applicants who can hit the ground running, are able to learn quickly and work efficiently.</p>
<p>The competitive placements in all of our career fields ensure students develop confidence and professional poise, allowing them to thrive in any environment. Those who complete internships during college enter the workforce with the knowledge they have successfully applied their knowledge in professional settings, and without the uncertainty that plagues many recent grads.</p>
<p>Of course, interns also develop skills in public speaking and giving presentations, two essential abilities in any role. They problem solve, and develop creative solutions that make them valuable members of the teams they join as well as outstanding applicants for full-time roles.</p>
